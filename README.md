# Physics-Practicum

One of the elective courses in the second semester is Physics Practicum. As part of the course, we will work on modeling physical phenomena and interpreting the results obtained by applying numerical calculation or simulation in Python. 

Every week we will do assignments and mini projects in the Jupiter notebook that I will share with you. I look forward to this course! :four_leaf_clover:	:relieved:
